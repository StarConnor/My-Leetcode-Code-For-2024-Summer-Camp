# My leetcode Code

## Introduction
<b>Some</b> **some** <strong>some<strong>are based on the work done by others, and all code is based on C++. This is just a repository aimed to record my progress of DataStructure&Algorithms practice, and used for the 2024 CS summer camp test.

## Note:
>You can run any code in VScode but you should be careful of `.vscode/tasks.json` and `./vscode/launch.json` which specify the path of gcc in my computer and there is of a chance that the path is not compatible with your environment. So please check the TWO files before you use them in VScode in your environment.

>Besides, the `Makefile` is also specified, and you should edit the 5th row beginning with "SOURCE", and fill in the cpp file that you want to run.

## Reference

I have created my code based on the two pdfs in the directory "Reference", they are "LeetCode 101 - A LeetCode Grinding Guide(C++ Version).pdf"(Author: Chang Gao, [original repository](https://github.com/changgyhub/leetcode_101/)) and "leetcode-cpp.pdf"(Author: soulmachine@gmail.com, [original repository](https://github.com/changgyhub/leetcode_101/)). Thank very much of the authors of these two books as I have gain inspiration from them.
