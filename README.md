# My leetcode Code

## Introduction
Some code are based on the work done by others, this is just my repository of recording my progress of DataStructure&Algorithms, and prepare for the 2024 CS summer camp test.

## Note:
>You can run any code in VScode but you should be careful of `.vscode/tasks.json` and `./vscode/launch.json` which specify the path of gcc in my computer and there is of a chance that the path is not compatible with your environment. So please check the TWO files before you use them in VScode in your environment.

>Besides, the `Makefile` is also specified, and you should edit the 5th row beginning with "SOURCE", and fill in the cpp file that you want to run.
